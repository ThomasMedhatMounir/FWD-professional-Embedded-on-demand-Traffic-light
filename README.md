Introduction

The system is a traffic light on a street where cars and pedestrian take actions based on the current 
traffic color for example Green is move, Yellow is take care the color will change and Red is stop 
both for car and pedestrian traffic light. Knowing that the color changes every five seconds.
The traffic light moves on its own as it is controlled by normal mode where pedestrian has to wait 
till the car traffic color become red so the pedestrian light turns green so he/she can move. In case 
of what if the pedestrian needs to move now should he/she wait for that amount of time. 
This case can be handled by our traffic light where there is a button to be pressed. When the button 
is pressed the traffic light change it is color to suit the pedestrian need without causing ciaos or 
worst accident.


Our system aims to provide a control on the traffic light with the pedestrian button

System function is to detect if the button is pressed or not if it is pressed then it switches to the 
pedestrian mode if not it is in the normal mode. Also it decides the next action based on the past 
action allowing pedestrian to pass after stopping the cars.
